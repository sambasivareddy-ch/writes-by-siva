# 💬 Introducing Our New Thread-Based Comment System!
We’re excited to announce a brand new comment feature on our blogging platform — designed to make discussions more engaging, organized, and secure!  
## Here’s what’s new 👇
### 🧵 1. Thread-Based Conversations
No more messy comment sections! You can now reply directly to specific comments, creating clear, easy-to-follow threads. Each conversation stays organized, so readers can dive into discussions without losing context.   

### 🔐 2. Simple Sign-In with Gmail or GitHub
To ensure a safe and spam-free environment, users are now required to sign in before commenting or replying. You can quickly log in using your Gmail or GitHub account — no complicated forms, no extra passwords.   

### 👍 3. Like and Engage
Show appreciation for insightful comments with a simple Like! You can also reply directly to others’ thoughts, sparking meaningful discussions right beneath each post.   

### 🧑‍💻 4. Privacy First — Always
We value your privacy. Our system does not store any personal information, except for your username or display name & an unique user ID — just enough to identify who’s participating in the conversation.   

### ⏱️ 5. Real-Time, Human-Friendly Timestamps
No need to check the clock! Comments now display relative timestamps like “2s ago,” “4 mins ago,” “yesterday,” or “last week.” This gives a natural, real-time feel to every interaction.

### 🚮 6. Delete the Comments
Allows users to delete their own comments which we will identified by the unique  user ID (uid) stored when the comment is added.

## 🚀 Start the Conversation
We built this new comment system to make sharing ideas and feedback easier, faster, and more enjoyable.
