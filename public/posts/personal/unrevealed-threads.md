# Unrevealed Threads 📝
Hello People ❤️  
----
It's been some time since I have been writing the blogs on this page. Most of my blogs so far have been aligned with my **technical and work interests**, and I’ve received great feedback from readers (okay, maybe I’m bragging a little 🙃).    
Now, after gaining some confidence in my writing **_(ps: still a naive writer)_**, I’m starting a new series called **"Unrevealed Threads"**. Here, I’ll share my reflections, experiences, lessons, and other thoughts on various aspects of life. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them!

Thank You for reading!
