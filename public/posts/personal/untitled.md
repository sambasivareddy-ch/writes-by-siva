# Extroverts, Introverts and There is Me!!
People in this world can fall into any of the two categories "an Extrovert or an Introvert" as far I know. An extrovert knows how to share what they are feeling and easily blends with People. While introvert might takes time to open their own closed world for the new people to enter, but when that opened, tah da!! they are the extroverts in their own world.   

And there is ME!! Who can able to disappear like never exists, don't talk to people for months, and even
when wanted to talk, My standard script is:   
1. Hi/Hello
2. How are you?
3. Had Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner
4. What are you doing now?
5. .........   

And that's end of it 😅. Made me wondering how these people talks/chats for hours, days. How they got so
many topics to talk?, which I am pretty sure I can't crack in this lifetime 😭.
