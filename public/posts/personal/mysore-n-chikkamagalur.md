## The Core
We all started from our respective station the day before i.e Aug 13. And We all reached the Bangalore early in the morning of next day. Weather in the Bangalore is so cool, that I realise that what people saying about bangalore weather is not a lie. And then we pickup Urmila and headed towards **Mysore**.

> Funny Conversation: Once we started towards the Mysore, we started talking, enjoying & gossipping. And in the flow, I called Harsha with slow voice, which was caught by Swapna & Urmila. And they teased us through out the trip about it.

## Day-1 (Mysore)
### Payana Car Museum
Our first stop was the "Payana Car Museum", a paradise of vintage cars, bikes and other vehicles. It will be the fest for any car enthuasists or photographers, took some good photos and then we headed straight to **Mysore Palace**.

### Mysore Palace 
We have forget to get 'Selfie Stick', so we have ordered a selfie stick to Mysore Palace on Blinkit/Zepto. Palace was so beautiful in & out. Took tons of pics and made some reels and laughs while doing them, those laughs are in my mind are still young. Then went on taking the pics in front of Palace, there we have placed the selfie stick on the fence and forget it there. So the life-span of that selfie stick is 2hours üòÇ.

### Church
I forget to mention, we also visited Cathedral Church, which is the second largest church in Asia. It was my first visit to a church, it was a good experience. Tbh, it looks exactly same as how we see the inside of a church in the movies. Spent some time there before starting to next place.

### Lalitha Mahal Palace
Popularly know as **KGF Lalitha Mahal Palace** since this palace is used in the shooting of the KGF movie. They had given the complimentary coffee, we had it took some pics and then we started to _Vrindavan Garden_.

### Vrindavan Garden
It more like night street shopping place next to a reservoir and a park to it. It also had **water show**, seeing the I remembered the **water show** I saw in Vizag's central park back in my college days. Did some shopping, bought sweater, hats which are never used during entire trip üò≠.

At last, the day in mysore completed with lot of laughters, fun and pics. And we started to Chikkamagaluru on the same day.

## Day-2 (Chikkamagalur)
- We have reached at around `1 AM` in the morning to the chikkamagalure and at around `7:30PM`, we started our journey of visiting the Chikkamagalur. And the first place is **Mullayanagiri**.
> The rain prediction on that day was **_85%_**. So as expected there was rain all over the 
day, unlike how we took shelter when rains in cities/towns, we enjoyed a lot in that rain without any worries (ofcourse we wore the raincoats üòÖ).

### Mullayanagiri
We have reached the base point of peak and took a zeep ride to reach another base point,
from there we have to trek around `1.5 - 2.0kms`. That short ride in the zeep is a cinema itself includes songs, twists, speed and sudden appearal of vehicles before to scare us more, mainly Urmila scared more as she sits in front seat. 

We started trekking 2km, there was rain and wind, but they didn't stop us. It was such an 
experience, you won't forget for lifetime, taking rain cold slaps on the face, holding the hands to beat the wind which is trying to make us turn into superman, taking breaks at every 400-500m, imitating the people infront of us. At last we reached the peak which is at `6300.017ft` above the sea level. And to amaze more, there is a temple of "Shiva", which felt so devotional at times and at the same time I remembered the movies, where actors went deep into forest to workship their gods.

### Jheri Waterfalls
The one & only disappointment of the trip is not able to visit this waterfalls. Since it 
is a rainy day, there is no network at all in the mountains, and we have to take a zeep ride to reach the waterfalls, so the zeep drivers are boarding the people who has the **Hand Cash**, which we don't have. Ran from the zeep to the zeep in the hope of someone will board us and accepts UPI, but all gone into vain. One leason learnt here is if you ever go to hill stations or hilly area, please do carry 'Hand Cash'.

### Dattapeeta & Manikya Daara
Basically to reach every place, you have to take the zeep ride. By the time we reach the 
base point to reach the place, the rain got heavier and so the coldness, the temperature comes to 15deg Celsius. In addition to the weather, we sat in the backside of the zeep which is a open area, in response to that our bones started dancing üò≠üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, smoke coming out of mouth like we are chain smokers üí®üòÇ. At last we reached spot, and to tackle the coldness, we bought a hot sweetcorn which gave us some heat. **Manikya Daara** waterfalls is nearer to that place and we went to saw, the water is freezing cold that our hands looses the senses, Harsha & Swapna are one step ahead that they went under it ü•∂.

And that's it for the Day-2 (Day-1 in chikkamagaluru), a day where raincoats dominates our outfits, rain dominates the sun, fog covers the greenary views but nothing stops us having the fun üòâ.

### The Uno Game
How can I end about this day about mentioning what happened in the Uno game. The game was played by Me, Harsha and Urmila, swapna took rest as she felt tried. As everyone knows, in the Uno, we have power cards like +4, +2, reverse, skip etc. If one player places +4, the next player has to 4 cards from the pool similarly for +2. So here is what happened
> In one of the game, Harsha got two +2 power cards, but he didn't know that we both do have two +2 cards. Without knowing it, he places one +2 card, then urmila added another +2 to it, then me, then again he (now we have 4 +2 cards), then urmila realized in last minute that she also has another +2, so she placed that +2, then me, which means there `6 x +2` made harsha to pick 12 cards. Wait wait, I guess Harsha picked only 10 cards üò∂

## Day-3 (Chikkamagalur)
    Actually we planned trek this day to "Gangadikkal (4 + 4km)", since all felt tried we cancelled that one.

So, we shifted the **Hebbe Waterfalls** from Day-4 itinerary to Day-3. The first place we visited is **Kallathigiri Falls**.

### Kallathigiri Falls
Kallathigiri Falls is relatively the smaller water falls we visited in the entire trip. What facinated me is, on the other side of the waterfalls, a temple is carved in the mountain üôåüèª, we have to cross the waterfalls flow to reach the temple. And first we went upside of the waterfalls to take the pics and then to temple to offers the prayers. It is relatively spanned for shorter time.

### Hebbe Waterfalls 
As usually, we have waited at the base point for 1-1.5hours to get into the zeep. From the base point, it is nearly **5-6kms** to reach the waterfalls. The zeep ride is nothing short of rollercoaster ride, it is completely a off-road with lots of pits, trees bends into the roads, so we **_dunked, jumped, danced a lot_** but the views are so magnificant. At last we reached the another point, from there we have to walk another 800m to go nearer the waterfalls (I will about it later). And the waterfall is flowing at it's full capacity and it's worth visiting atleast once in the lifetime and I remembered the dialogue **Worth Verma Worth...** ‚ù§Ô∏è

### The 800m
Maybe it is over exaggerating but worth mentioning. These 800m felt like a squid game where you have to cross the each huddle to get the reward. Since, it is raining, the path is so slippery, we felt it better to slide then walk to reach the falls, that much slippery it is. We saw people falling on their back, to their front and making their outfits turn into **Brown**. We four formed two teams, Harsha & Swapna, Me & Urmila, the later walked like nothing meant to them, my group walked so slow holding the trees along the path, checking for roots in the path to get the grip, it was such a good and tough experience ü´°.

### Z-Point Viewpoint
And this is the last place on day-3, we went to see the greenary, but as expected that greenary is covered with fog. So spent little time there trying to take the timelapse of clouds moving but no success and then we returned to the stay.
