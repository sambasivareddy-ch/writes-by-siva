# Social (Media) Being
Title is a bit weird, right ? Well, I thought of the same… but ehhh, I am going with it 😅. By seeing the title, you might have an idea of **“What was going to be part of this blog?”**, yes, that’s right. Indeed, this blog is about **_“Social Media”_**.

> **Disclaimer**: I am no expert in Human Psychology or any field to write a blog on Social Media, this blog is purely about my reflections on it or at-least about what level of influence social media has on me.

We are in an era _"where sending a reel is equivalent to sending a text, Hi. Apparently, if someone reacts to your reel, it means you’re still part of their circle; taking time to send those reels is equal to putting effort in.  Posting to get validation or get comments like ❤️/🔥"_. 

That’s what at least I thought 💭. But when I decided to let it go, I thought I might feel a bit of missing out on catching up with people, their updates, and what’s happening around the world, not exactly the world but cricket 🚶

And it’s been 21days, I have deleted my all social media accounts except WhatsApp and LinkedIn. **Why not WhatsApp, because this is no more a letter writing era 😂. Regarding LinkedIn, you know the reason**. There’s a saying that if you stick to something for 21 days, there’s an 80% chance you’ll keep it.

Before this 21days, I used to open the Instagram every few mins like I own it 😂. Reacting to the messages within few minutes and seeing stories which posted less then 10s ago and if I posted something, I might have checked it more often then my followers. _If there is an option to like the post as many times you want, I might have hit more likes than my followers 😅._ It’s been like my second home and same goes for Snapchat, not as more as Instagram but for 4-5 snaps I received in a day that’s a lot. **_Due to this, my screen time has reached a peak time of `15h` at one point. (Don’t worry that day I was on leave to work). And that means I kept phone away only to sleep_** 😴   

But now after 3 weeks, **_my screentime hits all time low of 2h21mins_**, which never seen after the year 2020. Yes, at earlier I got scared that it if I was no active in social media, will someone knows my existence and message me, turns out there exists few people (if they are reading it they might know ❤️).

And maybe that’s what this whole thing taught me — the ones who truly care don’t need your “online presence” to remember you. They just... show up. And help me to learnt that connection between two people never meant to be the sending the reels, posting you good pics online, sharing your updates over instagram story or snap.

Maybe being social isn’t about being seen, it’s about staying connected — with yourself first. It did help me divert most of my time away from screens — sorry sorry, as a software engineer, avoiding them is almost impossible 🫠, ok let me frame like this preventing me from… what the word? unnecessary screen time.

> So will I go back on Social Media?   
> Well, no in **99.999999999%**, ok which is closer to 100, so make it 100% 🏃
