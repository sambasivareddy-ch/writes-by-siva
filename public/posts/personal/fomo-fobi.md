# FOMO? Nope, I’ve Got FOBI!
We all know about FOMO — Fear of Missing Out. It’s that little things in your brain that says, **“Everyone’s having fun without you.”** But me? Nah. I don’t have FOMO. I’ve got **_FOBI_** — Fear Of Being Included.

Sounds weird, right? Let me explain.

## The “FOMO Phase”
I used to want FOMO. **I thought being part of the group, making friends, and hanging out was the dream.** And for a while, it worked. I made friends. We laughed. We vibed. Life was good… until suddenly, it wasn’t. Things drifted apart, and I found myself replaying the greatest hits of _“What Went Wrong?”_ in my head.

> Should I patch things up? Should I just let it go? The mental tug-of-war was exhausting. So I did what any socially-overthinking human would do — I slowly pulled away, but those memories are still young in my heart and will be forever.

## Enter: FOBI
That’s when **FOBI kicked in. I wasn’t afraid of missing out anymore**. I was afraid of being included again. Because what if history repeated itself? What if the cycle of “great connection → sudden drift” came back?

So instead, I became my own favorite company.
- I’ve gone on solo dates (yes, I booked a table for one and didn’t even hide behind my phone).
- I’ve watched movies alone in theaters, popcorn bucket all to myself.
- I’ve eaten surrounded by hundreds of people, and guess what? Nobody actually cared that I was by myself.
- And honestly? It wasn’t lonely. It was liberating.

## The Plot Twist
Spending time alone gave me clarity (not full clarity — let’s not pretend I’ve reached Pro level yet). But I started liking the idea that I can enjoy life without depending on someone else’s availability or approval.  

Still, every now and then, the thought of making new friends back in. Will it work? Will it flop? Who knows! But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that life has its own sense of humor… and I’m here for the ride.
