# v2.5 Release Notes ❤️
It's been nearly **25 years** since a human called **_Venkata Naga Gopi Samba Siva Reddy_** (uff, that's a long name - Govt. Records scared of his name 🫠) first deployed on the **Planet Earth**. And yes, that human is me, Me is him.  

After 25 years of uptime and running on this planet Earth 🌏, this human project version reached to v2.5, a major version upgrade of his time on this Earth and ready to release and countdown has started already.  

## Major Features 🧠
- **Auto-Debugging Mode**: When something happens now this human can debug by himself (in most cases).
  - Known Limitation: requires extra processing by **human-AI** module called Overthinking.
- **Better Emotional Stability**: Now handles exceptions most of the time.
- **Downgraded to No Social Media Era 🫡**: Performance testing is in progress but going with release. Hope there is _No possible rollback due to **FOMO**(Fear-Of-Missing-Out)_.

## 🐞 Known Bugs
- Still throwing **NullPointerException** whenever this human searches for love.
  - Root Cause: He himself rarely initiates conversations in first place 😂
- Connection threads auto-terminate after 6months of runtime, thinks about fixing them but never tried.
- Frequent **StackOverflow** Error due to infinite thinking loops.
- Github timeline streak breaks every **20 days** - cron job needs to be fixed.

## 🎮 Major Stats
- Sorry, these are under **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** 🏃 will be unlocked with Premium Subscription 😭.

## Metrics
- **Uptime** - 25years
- **Sleep Cycle** - Inconsistent
- **CPU Usage** - Spikes when random thoughts or past hits
- **Memory** - Filled with Beautiful Memory, lessons and painful moments.
- **Logs** - Overflowing with lot of _WARNINGS_ and few _ERRORS_ that turned into lessons, fixes definitely gonna deploy ASAP.

## Final Thoughts 📝
25 years of **commits, rollbacks and unexpected system crashes** - and somehow this human system still compiles and working fine. Fingers-crossed for next decade where major upgrades unlocks 🤞🚀.
