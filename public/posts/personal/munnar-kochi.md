# Munnar & Kochi ❤️
Hello All,   
Well, this blog is to digitalize my first trip **"Munnar & Kochi"** which happened back in **"September 2024"**, but still making me laugh
when thinking of it.

## When Happened ??
September 20, 2024 to September 22, 2024

## With Whom?
- Eekshitha
- Tejaswini
- Mounika
- Rishitha
- Deepak
- Rahul
- Me

## The Core
People who know me, obviously knows how hard it is for them to make me talk or have a solid conversation for about atleast 10minutes 🙂. And more to that I am going to meet **4 new people**, so I let you think how hard it is going for me to involve in conversation without making people bore (PS: In this one year time, I think improved a lot, I think... 😅).  
And that day arrived i.e **19th September, 2025** and met all the people who never know me and existence of me. At first, you obvisouly know you are **imposter** among them because they all know each other, but to my surprise they all welcoming and became friends in no time.
### The Highlights
Ok, it is lot to write so I am gonna list all the place we visit in those 3days in order. The places & activities includes **Athiripally Waterfalls, Ziplining, Sky Waking, Spice Garden, Tea Factory, Mattupetty Dam, Echo Point, Gap Road, Fort Kochi**. If you guys (readers) planning Munnar, feel free to use above itinerary 🏃 and include **Kolukkumalai** to it.   
### Still fresh in Mind
- Star Game
  - King: Deepak
  - Thief: Mounika
  - About me? I turned out to be **Police**
- "Paddling in **Mattupetty Dam**", My legs still felt the pain by thinking of it but in a good way. It took me & rishitha to return the start point **1 hour 🥲😂** when all other reached it before and had snacks.

## Final Thoughts
This trip might had started as Unplanned, **but ended with giving best experience ever gave to some whose trip was the first trip**.
