## Plot
The story follows Santiago, a young Andalusian shepherd who **repeatedly dreams of a hidden treasure near the Egyptian pyramids**. Motivated by these dreams, he embarks on a journey that takes him across unfamiliar lands, cultures, and challenges.   

Along the way, Santiago encounters mentors, omens, and setbacks that shape his understanding of life, love, and destiny. His journey becomes less about material wealth and more about personal growth, faith, and alignment with one’s purpose.
